# Enhanced Matching Algorithm - Partial Matching Support

## Overview
The enhanced matching algorithm introduces sophisticated partial matching capabilities to improve mentor-student pairing accuracy and coverage. Instead of strict binary matching, the system now supports fuzzy matching, similarity scoring, and contextual relationships.

## Key Improvements

### 1. University Matching Enhancements

**Before:**
```sql
CASE WHEN mr.university = ANY($1) THEN 0.3 ELSE 0.0 END
```

**After:**
```sql
GREATEST(
    -- Exact match (highest score)
    CASE WHEN mr.university = ANY($1) THEN 0.3 ELSE 0.0 END,
    -- Partial name matching
    CASE WHEN EXISTS (...LIKE '%' || LOWER(target_uni) || '%'...) THEN 0.2 ELSE 0.0 END,
    -- Tier-based matching (similar ranking)
    CASE WHEN ABS(ranking_difference) <= 50 THEN 0.15 ELSE 0.0 END
)
```

**Reasons for Change:**
- **Increased Coverage**: Students searching for "Stanford" now match mentors from "Stanford University"
- **Tier Flexibility**: Students targeting top-tier schools get recommendations from similar-ranked institutions
- **Reduced Zero Matches**: Fewer cases where students get no recommendations due to exact name mismatches

### 2. Major Matching Enhancements

**Before:**
```sql
CASE WHEN mr.major = ANY($2) THEN 0.25 ELSE 0.0 END
```

**After:**
```sql
GREATEST(
    -- Exact match
    CASE WHEN mr.major = ANY($2) THEN 0.25 ELSE 0.0 END,
    -- Related majors (CS ↔ Software Engineering)
    CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM major_relations...) THEN 0.18 ELSE 0.0 END,
    -- Same category (STEM, Business, etc.)
    CASE WHEN same_category THEN 0.12 ELSE 0.0 END,
    -- Keyword partial matching
    CASE WHEN keyword_match THEN 0.08 ELSE 0.0 END
)
```

**Reasons for Change:**
- **Interdisciplinary Recognition**: Computer Science students can find Data Science mentors
- **Career Transition Support**: Business students can connect with Finance/Marketing mentors
- **Broader Expertise**: Students get access to mentors in related fields who can provide valuable insights

### 3. Degree Level Flexibility

**Before:**
```sql
CASE WHEN mr.degree_level = $3 THEN 0.2 ELSE 0.0 END
```

**After:**
```sql
CASE 
    WHEN mr.degree_level = $3 THEN 0.2
    WHEN adjacent_degrees THEN 0.1  -- Master ↔ PhD
    WHEN related_degrees THEN 0.05  -- Bachelor ↔ Master
    ELSE 0.0
END
```

**Reasons for Change:**
- **Experience Sharing**: PhD students can mentor Master's students (and vice versa)
- **Career Progression**: Bachelor students can learn from Master's degree holders
- **Flexible Guidance**: Different degree levels offer different perspectives

### 4. Dynamic Scoring System

**New Features:**
- **Experience Bonus**: More experienced mentors get higher scores
- **Specialty Matching**: Mentors with relevant service specialties get bonus points
- **Language Partial Matching**: Supports multilingual scenarios
- **String Similarity**: Uses difflib for fuzzy text matching

**Reasons for Implementation:**
- **Quality Assurance**: Experienced mentors are prioritized
- **Service Alignment**: Matches students with mentors offering specific services
- **Global Support**: Better matching for international students
- **Typo Tolerance**: Handles minor spelling variations

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- University rankings for tier-based matching
CREATE TABLE university_rankings (
    university VARCHAR(255),
    ranking INTEGER,
    tier VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Major relationships for cross-field matching
CREATE TABLE major_relations (
    major1 VARCHAR(255),
    major2 VARCHAR(255),
    similarity_score DECIMAL(3,2)
);

-- Major categories for broad field matching
CREATE TABLE major_categories (
    major VARCHAR(255),
    category VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### Algorithm Flow

1. **Exact Matching**: Start with precise matches (highest scores)
2. **Partial Matching**: Apply fuzzy matching for missed connections
3. **Relationship Matching**: Use predefined relationships (majors, universities)
4. **Similarity Scoring**: Calculate string similarity for edge cases
5. **Bonus Application**: Add experience and specialty bonuses
6. **Score Normalization**: Ensure fair comparison across all factors

### Performance Optimizations

- **Indexed Lookups**: All relationship tables have proper indexes
- **Limited Result Sets**: Query optimization with appropriate limits
- **Cached Calculations**: Similarity scores can be pre-computed
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful degradation to simpler matching if needed

## Impact Assessment

### Expected Improvements

1. **Match Coverage**: +40-60% more students receive relevant recommendations
2. **Match Quality**: More nuanced scoring leads to better mentor-student fit
3. **User Satisfaction**: Reduced "no results" scenarios
4. **Platform Growth**: Better matching encourages more user engagement

### Potential Risks

1. **Score Inflation**: Too many partial matches might dilute quality
2. **Performance Impact**: More complex queries may slow response times
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Relationship tables need regular updates

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Threshold Management**: Set minimum scores to filter low-quality matches
2. **Caching Strategy**: Implement result caching for popular queries
3. **Data Governance**: Establish processes for maintaining relationship data
4. **A/B Testing**: Gradual rollout with performance monitoring

## Configuration Options

The enhanced algorithm supports configuration through environment variables:

```python
# Minimum scores for inclusion
MIN_UNIVERSITY_SCORE = 0.1
MIN_MAJOR_SCORE = 0.08
MIN_TOTAL_SCORE = 0.3

# Similarity thresholds
STRING_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.6
UNIVERSITY_RANKING_TOLERANCE = 50

# Bonus multipliers
EXPERIENCE_BONUS_MULTIPLIER = 1.2
SPECIALTY_BONUS_MULTIPLIER = 1.1
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Match Distribution**: Score ranges and match quality
2. **Coverage Metrics**: Percentage of requests with matches
3. **User Engagement**: Click-through rates on recommendations
4. **Performance Metrics**: Query execution times
5. **Feedback Scores**: User satisfaction with matches

### Dashboard Recommendations

- Real-time matching success rates
- Popular major/university combinations
- Algorithm performance metrics
- User feedback trends

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use ML models for similarity scoring
2. **Behavioral Matching**: Consider user interaction patterns
3. **Temporal Factors**: Weight recent graduates higher for current trends
4. **Geographic Preferences**: Factor in location preferences
5. **Industry Alignment**: Match based on target career paths

## Conclusion

The enhanced partial matching algorithm significantly improves the platform's ability to connect students with relevant mentors while maintaining match quality. The hierarchical scoring system ensures that exact matches are still prioritized while opening up new opportunities for meaningful connections across related fields and institutions.
